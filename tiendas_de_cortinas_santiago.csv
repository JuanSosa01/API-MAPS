They have a reported office that is located on Sucre Street, but when I go, they tell me that they rented an office there, but they left more than two years ago. The receptionist also indicates that several clients have arrived at this place. Today I see that the address was edited, without mentioning the number where they are supposedly located.\n3.- When closing the deal, they send you a manual of everything you must do, conditions to start work and other topics. This manual does not specify installation guarantees for the customer, for example, that they will not damage the walls, etc...\n4.- The installation is coordinated, but they only bring part of the materials, because the differential was not ready. The corresponding claim is generated, since the installation of these curtains involves moving the furniture near the windows and it is not a minor job to have to do it more than once.\n5.- While they were installing the rails, they began to carry the siding of the building, as well as the railings with the drill. They repaired it with plaster, but in the afternoon it fell, putting someone at risk of falling into the pool.\n6.- A claim was made regarding the terminations, installing only one screw at the end of the rails to prevent the curtain from coming off.\n7.- After the complaints, another person appeared giving instructions to generate good quality work, however, these instructions were not followed by the installation personnel. If you bring a master to repair the details.\n8.- They finish the installation of the curtains, after requesting: level the rails, change those that were scratched and approve the installation. It is understood that in some places they left the rail inside the wall and in another on the outskirts. I do highlight that they brought details such as shells to hold the curtains together, which were not included in the installation.\n9.- A count of all the details is taken and the master repairs it with wall paste. I took a color sample, but when painting it looked very light so it was removed after taking a new sample. Then he returned to assist with darker paint, so he left without carrying out the work. You end up mixing both paints and painting the terrace, however, when it dries, you notice that the amount of paint was insufficient.\n10.- Without further news from the company, buy paint and we will repair the details.
